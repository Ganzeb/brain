# brain - Neural Network for STATA
**brain** is a no frills implementation of a backpropagation algorithm designed for a hassle free setup of multi-layered neural networks. After training the whole network can be saved/loaded using so called brain-files (default postfix .brn). The network is represented by a set of reserved matrices to provide transparent access to all components and to support older Stata versions. Additional functions facilitate the calculation of pseudo-marginal effects or signal through-put, but the main utility is of course prediction, i.e. for propensity scores or classification.
